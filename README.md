# ROTTEN-TOMATOES-Insights-Project

### Business Task
Use a Rotten Tomatoes dataset of Hollywood's Most Profitable Stories to create a dashboard.

### Data Set
* Rotten Tomatoes dataset ([original source](https://public.tableau.com/s/sites/default/files/media/HollywoodsMostProfitableStories.csv) found at [Tableau Public resources](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/resources) > Sample Data > Hollywood's Most Profitable Stories) (.csv)

### Highlights
- The animation genre has the highest average rating, at 80.33.
- The highest-rated movie is "WALL-E" with a rating of 96.
- From the scatterplot we can see that there is no correlation between worldwide gross and Tomatometer score.
- the audience score seems to be always higher than the Tomatometer score, with a significant difference in the action genre, the exception being the animation genre where the Tomatometer score is higher than the audience score.
